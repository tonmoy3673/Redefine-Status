                    The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an individual. Status is a form of positive competitive drive in society and a tool for respect attribution. That's why you see Dior shoes in economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the status from spending $1100 on shoes does have more long term value than things like first class because we are playing the game of unenlightened capitalism.

                    The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100 and does no good for humanity.  Thus this expenditure is not a failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do not have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in Bangladesh (a small home can be built as a permanent structure for someone for this amount).  We need higher forms of status to exist in order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of wealth and power on a systemic level.
